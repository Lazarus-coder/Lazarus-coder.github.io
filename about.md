Hi, I’m Ilya (Ao Jiang) — born in Xinjiang, raised on a diet of wind, dust, and existential questions, now based in Seattle trying to survive a Computational Linguistics master’s degree at the University of Washington.

My academic path is a strange mix: Software Engineering & English in undergrad, now CLMS at UW, where I spend half my time implementing NLP models and 另一半怀疑人生。  
I’m equally comfortable discussing syntax trees, language models, or 人类命运的荒诞本质 — usually all in the same conversation。

This site is where I dump thoughts, notes, experiments, writing attempts, and things that don’t fit anywhere else.

### More Information

I’m interested in NLP, large language models, semantics, comparative literature, human behavior, and why 人生会经常按我意料之外的方向发展。

I like fitness, cooking, long-form writing, and designing small personal systems that make chaotic life feel 稍微有点秩序。

未来想做和 LLM、语言工程相关的脏活累活。
